I have two wonderful children, and come from a good family. I have worked from the bottom to the top. In 2005 I helped build the family farms commercial fruit packing facility, and have managed it every season since. Volunteering as an EMT, I’ve seen people at their worst, and people at their best. It has been rewarding to be part of a team helping people in times of emergent need.\n\nI believe my experience in farm management and medical experience will lend itself well into being part of the team that manages our county. I am fiscally conservative. I believe in a limited government that uses resources to help build up business and community. I loathe burdensome over-regulation and wasteful spending of hard earned taxpayer dollars.",
