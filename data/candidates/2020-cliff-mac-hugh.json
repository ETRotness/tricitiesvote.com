I have two wonderful children, and come from a good family. I have worked from the bottom to the top. In 2005 I helped build the family farms commercial fruit packing facility, and have managed it every season since.  Volunteering as an EMT, I&rsquo;ve seen people at their worst, and people at their best. It has been rewarding to be part of a team helping people in times of emergent need.\n</p>\n<p>I believe my experience in farm management and medical experience will lend itself well into being part of the team that manages our county. I am fiscally conservative. I believe in a limited government that uses resources to help build up business and community. I loathe burdensome over-regulation and wasteful spending of hard earned taxpayer dollars.</p>",
