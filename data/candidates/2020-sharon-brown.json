Since 2013 I have been creating, revising and establishing policy to become law, thus I understand the true meaning of the law, and how it should be applied. Additionally, as a trained mediator, I learned to be absolutely neutral with no bias towards one side or the other. My background as a business attorney facilitated my arguments against a proposed banking tax law that would create a burden for Washingtonâ€™s small businesses. The law was ultimately struck down by the ruling of a Superior Court Judge. My judicial philosophy is to follow the law as written and to give the taxpayers a good return on their investment by having a strong work ethic. Through my eight years in the Legislature I have a rare 100% attendance record and have never missed a single vote. I pledge to dedicate that same level of effort as a Superior Court Judge for Benton and Franklin counties. I would be honored to receive your vote.",
