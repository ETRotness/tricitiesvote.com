Matt Boehnke is already a leader in Olympia, recognized for his expertise in technology and cyber security by both parties. Matt&rsquo;s also the sort of leader who listens, works well with others, and he has a servant&rsquo;s heart. In short, Matt is the kind of leader we need more of in government. <br />\n<br />\nWith our vote, Matt can continue working to promote higher education locally and statewide, because education and research create good jobs.
