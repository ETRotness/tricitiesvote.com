Schoesler supported emergency measures to keep people safe. Now, he is leading the charge on safely restarting our economy. Schoesler and Republican legislators crafted restart plans to get low-risk workers and small business owners back to their livelihoods.\n\nAs Senate Minority Leader, Sen. Schoesler pushed back against extreme Seattle sex-education policies that took local control away from schools. When he was Majority Leader, the percentage of the state budget going to education increased from 46% to 51%, college tuition was cut, and safety improvements have restarted on key highways. He remains focused on agriculture which reflects his background as a fifth-generation farmer in Ritzville. Mark has worked closely with counties, schools, hospitals, universities, and public safety officials to protect the services we depend on.\n\nSen. Schoesler is a proven compassionate, thoughtful, and effective leader in Olympia, and our district would be best served to retain him in his current leadership role.",
