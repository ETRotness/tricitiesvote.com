While some of us have fared better in Washington State than in other states, many of us are still struggling to make ends meet; many are afraid of what the future holds. We have felt the burden in our region; unemployed individuals; businesses that are shut down; businesses that are dealing with dramatically new ways of operating to keep their doors open. I lost work during April and May. As head of household, it was frightening!<br />\n<br />\nI&rsquo;ve faced many financial hardships. I know what it is to struggle. I know what it is to be the recipient of help, and I wouldn&rsquo;t be where I am today without it&mdash;a strong, successful woman ready to fight for others who need assistance. People and small businesses need help now more than ever before. Small businesses are the backbone of our community. I will fight for you to get a larger slice of the pie when it comes to state aid. I will fight for the unemployed and the essential workers. We&rsquo;re all in this together. Honor me with your vote; I&rsquo;ll fight to ensure no one gets left behind.</p>",
