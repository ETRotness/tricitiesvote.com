A mental health facility that can serve the needs of youth and adults needs to be brought to the community and be available to not just those who have insurance, but also those that do not and those that can pay out of pocket for services.   \n  \nAs your next county Commissioner, I promise to be accessible, transparent, and responsive to the public that I serve.",
