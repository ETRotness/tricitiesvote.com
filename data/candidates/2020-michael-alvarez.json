Ronald Reagan    \n\nBenton County will be facing some very difficult Economic and Financial challenges due to Covid19.  I am the only candidate that has the Education and Extensive Financial and Business Experience needed to help ensure that taxpayers money is being used and leveraged in the best possible way so that wasteful spending does not occur and taxes are not increased unnecessarily.   \n\nA full review of the Public Safety Tax fund is critical.  I pledge to collaborate with city officials within the county to better utilize these funds to improve our public safety as the county continues to grow.  Since being elected to office I have a proven track record of saving taxpayers millions of dollars in taxes.  I’m a strong advocate for our youth, families, senior citizens, and veterans. I will continue to listen to the needs and concerns of our citizens.  My pledge is to be Present, Accountable, and Transparent to all citizens of Benton County.”     ",
