This means we deserve to go through life unafraid, that itâ€™s our right to be treated fairly, and respected. This means we believe in the value of all work, whether itâ€™s behind the desk, behind the register, or at the packing plant. We all deserve a living wage which keeps us sheltered, fed and secure. This means we believe in affordable healthcare for all. This means we believe in science and education. We believe real progress leaves no one behind and know we are stronger together.
