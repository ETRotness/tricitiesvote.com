  "statement": "I have resided in Kennewick since 1972, where my family and I owned and managed Beaver’s Furniture for 37 years.  I attended schools in the Kennewick School District - eventually going to Pullman, where I graduated as a “Coug” with a degree in economics.  I have a wife and 2 adult children. I am a grandpa of 4 granddaughters.  \nI would like to take this opportunity to thank the friends, neighbors, and community for helping me with my dream of “building a better community”.  My goal as a Benton County Commissioner is and has always been to search for ways to improve our County.  \nI look forward to continuing as your commissioner, and want to thank you for your support.",
