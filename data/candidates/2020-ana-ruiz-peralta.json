Franklin County has been the fastest growing county in the State of Washington for the last 20 consecutive years. My goals are to improve our overwhelmed and underfunded bi-county public health system as well as our juvenile justice system.\n\nIâ€™m running for Franklin County Commissioner because I believe Itâ€™s the Moment for decisive leadership thatâ€™s focused on smart growth policies that protect locally owned farms and I will work to create infrastructure for efficient internet connectivity for the county.\n\nIâ€™m proud to be raising my three amazing children in Franklin County. It is an attractive and welcoming community to everyone. I chose to live in here because of the quality of the education system in place and the economic growth opportunities.\n\nI will be an inclusive servant-leader to Franklin County as I work on the expansion and access to Franklin County Commissioner meetings and I will advocate to provide interpretation services at said meetings. Lastly, I will work to improve relationships with the Benton County Commissioners through cooperation and collaboration on key bi-county issues that impact all residents.",
