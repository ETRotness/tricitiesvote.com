Franklin County has been the fastest growing county in the State of Washington for the last 20 consecutive years. My goals are to improve our overwhelmed and underfunded bi-county public health system as well as our juvenile justice system.\n\nI’m running for Franklin County Commissioner because I believe It’s the Moment for decisive leadership that’s focused on smart growth policies that protect locally owned farms and I will work to create infrastructure for efficient internet connectivity for the county.\n\nI’m proud to be raising my three amazing children in Franklin County. It is an attractive and welcoming community to everyone. I chose to live in here because of the quality of the education system in place and the economic growth opportunities.\n\nI will be an inclusive servant-leader to Franklin County as I work on the expansion and access to Franklin County Commissioner meetings and I will advocate to provide interpretation services at said meetings. Lastly, I will work to improve relationships with the Benton County Commissioners through cooperation and collaboration on key bi-county issues that impact all residents.",
