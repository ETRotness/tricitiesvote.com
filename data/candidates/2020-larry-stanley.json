Teacher of ESL in Asia. Director of an international education program. Pastor of a Church in CA.  \n  \n**Education**  \nGraduate of Hanford High School, Richland WA  \nGraduate Bachelor of Arts from Life Pacific College, San Dimas CA  \n  \n  \n**Community Service**  \nNo information submitted  \n  \n  \n**Statement**  \nLarry will be a new kind of politician – a term limited, transparent public servant who puts state before Party and solutions before ideology.  \n  \nWe also need a new kind of informed, tolerant, discerning citizen – who is an “ally” to his or her fellow Americans. A citizen who doesn’t: vote straight party tickets; blindly adopt positions that are mandated by political tribe; vilify other Americans because of differences. Both major parties only focus on making the other side lose so that we all end up losing in the end. Not right, not left, move forward together.",
