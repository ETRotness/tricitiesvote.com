With her decades of legal experience and volunteer service to the Tri-City community, she sees the chance to become a Judge as a continuation of her community service.\n\nIn 2010, she committed to serving as a volunteer Arbitrator to provide fair and reasonable resolutions to cases to avoid congestion in the already crowded courts.
