  "statement": "**Elected Experience**  \nAs a first-time candidate, I’ll bring a needed bipartisan voice to the State Senate.  \n  \n**Other Professional Experience**  \n\nI proudly served our country as an American diplomat under Republican and Democratic administrations for nearly 14 years. I returned home in 2015 to serve as CEO of Sherwood Trust, one of Eastern Washington’s largest philanthropies.\n\n**Education**\n\nI graduated cum laude with honors in Politics from Whitman College and earned a Master of Public Administration from Columbia University.\n\n  \n**Community Service**  \n\nWhitman College volunteer, 1997-present, currently serving as President’s Advisory Board Vice Chair; Walla Walla’s Noon Rotary Club member and committee member for the YWCA and Community Council.\n\n  \n**Statement**  \n\nI love Eastern Washington and feel lucky to have been raised in Moses Lake and to make Walla Walla my home. Our region values hard work and serving our country and our communities. I have dedicated my life to these values and to putting people before partisan politics. \n\n  \n\nI’m running to bridge the divides between Eastern and Western Washington and our rural and urban communities. We need a government that works for us -- our farms, our businesses, our families. Our communities deserve a senator who will fight for the resources we need to thrive. On our farm, we value common sense and fiscal responsibility. Olympia needs more of both.\n\nThank you to the community leaders and organizations that have endorsed our campaign, including: State Senator Valoria Loveland (former), Megan Clubb, Walla Walla Police Chief Chuck Fulton (former), Pasco City Councilmember Rebecca Francik (former), Pasco City Councilmember Zahra Roach, College Place Mayor Norma Hernández, Columbia County Port Commissioner Fred Crowe (former), Washington State Labor Council, nurses and healthcare workers at SEIU 1199NW, our local teachers at Washington Education Association, Teamsters 839, electrical workers at IBEW 77, and many more.\n\nI ask for your vote and the honor of serving you.",
