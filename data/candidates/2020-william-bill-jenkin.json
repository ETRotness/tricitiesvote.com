Serving on key committees like tourism, international trade, economic development, the census and capital budget, I’ve worked hard promoting our district as a leader and securing the resources it deserves. If elected as your state Senator, I will continue to be an accessible and tireless advocate for you.\n\nThe coming years will be a challenge for state government and our district needs the experience I have as an effective representative of the people. A voice for common sense, pragmatic solutions, and conservative values in the Legislature, there's no question about what I will do for our communities because my record speaks for itself.\n\nI will prioritize state spending to reflect our values with existing tax dollars. I will protect water rights for rural communities, continue to stand up for parental rights in education, and work for economic prosperity for all.\n\nI'm proudly endorsed by prosecutors, county commissioners, mayors, sheriffs, and community leaders from across the district, in addition to senators from around the state.
