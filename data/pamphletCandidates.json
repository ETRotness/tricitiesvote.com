I would uphold the law and would not legislate any personal agenda. I feel that a Judge should be knowledgeable and experienced in all matters before them. A Judge should possess humility, a positive demeanor and temperament, and treat all those who come before the bench with respect and fairness regardless of their social or economic backgrounds. A Judge should never put their own interests before those of the court or the public for which they serve.",
